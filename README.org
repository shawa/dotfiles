* Dotfiles III

/Organised, even more, at last/

This is my third attempt at a Dotfiles repo and hopefully the /last/.

Config files are broken out in to [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]] packages corresponding to the program at hand.

To "install" (symlink) a package, =cd= to =.dotfiles= and just run:

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ stow install <package name>
#+END_SRC

Uninstall with

#+BEGIN_SRC 
$ stow -D <package name>
#+END_SRC

You can have it print out what changes are going to happen with the =-v= flag.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
/If you need a script to "install" your dotfiles, you're doing it wrong.''
#+END_QUOTE

Well Mr., if loose coupling and modularity is wrong, heck, I don't want to be /right/.
